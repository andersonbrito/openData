# Building a domain matrix

`domMatrix.py` performs the third step of the analysis pipeline. It takes the output generated by `hmmer2rep.py`, and generates a matrix of presence/absence of protein domains per genome.

## Running domMatrix.py

### Dependencies

For running `domMatrix.py`, the following Python3 package must be installed:

* BeautifulSoup

### Execution
`domMatrix.py` can be executed using a command line similar to:

```
python domMatrix.py -output dom_matrix.tsv
```

where the input files correspond to those in the folder `repertoire`, created while running `hmmer2rep.py`. Such folder must be placed in the working directory as the script above. As a result, `domMatrix.py` will generate as output a matrix of domain counts per taxa. See the `examples` directory for more details about input and output files.
