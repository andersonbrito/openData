# Building a matrix of domain presence/absence

`domMatrix.py` takes the output generated by `hmmer2rep.py`, and generates a matrix of presence/absence of protein domains per genome.

## Running domMatrix.py

`domMatrix.py` can be executed using a command line similar to:

```
python domMatrix.py '/path/to/input/files/'
```

where the input files correspond to those found in the folder `repertoire`, created while running `hmmer2rep.py`. Such folder must be placed in the working directory given as input above (`/path/to/input/files/`).
