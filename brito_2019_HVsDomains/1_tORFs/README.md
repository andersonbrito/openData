# Fetching translated ORFs

This code retrieves peptides encoded by genomes deposited on the NBCI repository. No matter if annotated in the genome or not, all open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 40 amino acids are retrieved, regardless of their initial codon.

### Prerequisites

For running `tORFs.py`, the following Python 3 package must be installed:

* Phylo (from Biopython)

## Inputs and Outputs

`tORFs.py` is run using a command similar to:

```
python tORFs.py /path/to/input/files/ auxFile
```
where the `auxFile` is a tab-delimited auxiliary file with lines containing genome accession numbers (eg. NC_018874) and an accronyms 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
