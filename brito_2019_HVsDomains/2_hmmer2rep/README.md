# Searching for domains

`hmmer2rep.py` belongs to the second step of the analysis pipeline. It searches for domain hits on HMMER (hmmscan) outputs (domtblout), and convert it into a custom format used in the next step of the pipeline. This script also retrieves the number of protein structures depicting such domains on Pfam.

## Getting Started

### Running hmmscan

Before running `hmmer2rep.py`, the user is expected to run `hmmscan` using the output sequences generated by `tORFs.py`. `hmmscan` is a software available is part of `HMMER`, which can be downloaded [here](http://hmmer.org/download.html). `hmmscan` scans for protein domains using aminoacid sequences using a protein profile HMM database. The most up to date HMM profile can be found at the [Pfam webiste](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/), a large file required for running `hmmscan`. To do so, this software can be run using a command line similar to:

```
hmmscan --domtblout domtblout.txt --acc --cut_ga /path/to/hmm/file/Pfam-A.hmm ./sequences.fasta
```

where the `sequences.fasta` is a concatenated file including all the entries generated `tORFs.py`. Once `hmmscan` finishes running (it may take a long time), it will output all domains found while scanning `sequences.fasta` as a text file (`domtblout.txt`), which will in turn be used to finally run `hmmer2rep.py`.

### Running hmmer2rep.py

`hmmer2rep.py` can be executed using a command similar to:

```
hmmer2rep.py /path/to/input/files/ 'domtblout.txt' 'auxFile'
```

where the `auxFile` is the same tab-delimited auxiliary file used for running `tORFs.py`. `hmmer2rep.py` will filter out unreliable hits `domtblout.txt`, exporting only those showing E-value ('protein E-value') and c-Evalue ('domain E-value') smaller or equal to 1e-03.
