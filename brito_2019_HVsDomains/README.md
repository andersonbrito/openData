# The evolution of viral domain repertoires

This repository contains data and code used during the analyses resulting in the article: [Brito, A.F. and Pinney, J.W., 2020. The evolution of protein domain repertoires: Shedding light on the origins of the Herpesviridae family. Virus Evolution, 6(1), p.veaa001.](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/6/1/veaa001/5726995).

The analyses performed in that article involved a series of steps, which can be reproduced following a pipeline of Python scripts:

```
tORFs → hmmer2rep → domMatrix → charEvol
                  ↓
               domAnnot
```

Access the directories dedicated to each script (above) for more details about their functioning.
