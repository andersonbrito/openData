# The evolution of viral domain repertoires

This repository contains data and code used during the analyses resulting in the (submitted) article: Brito, Anderson F., and John W. Pinney. "The evolution of protein domain repertoires: shedding light on the origins of herpesviruses." bioRxiv (2018): 423525 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/423525v1).

The analyses performed in that article involved a series of steps, which can be reproduced following a pipeline of Python scripts:

```
tORFs → hmmer2rep → domMatrix → charEvol
                  ↓
               domAnnot
```

Access the directories dedicated to each script (above) for more details about their functioning.
