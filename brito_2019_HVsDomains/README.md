# The evolution of viral domain repertoires

This repository contains data and code used during the analyses resulting in the article entitled *"The evolution of protein domain repertoires: shedding light on the origins of herpesviruses"*.

The analyses performed in that article involved a series of steps, which can be reproduced following a pipeline of Python scripts:

```
tORFs → hmmer2rep → domMatrix → charEvol
```

Access the directories dedicated to each script (above) for more details about their functioning.
