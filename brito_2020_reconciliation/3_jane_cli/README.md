## Running Jane on command line

To run Jane on command line, exploring several cost regimes, one can run the bash script `runJane.sh`, once [Jane](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/jane/index.html#get) is installed.


```
./runJane.sh virus-host_JaneTree.nex
```

`virus-host_JaneTree.nex` is the file generated by `nexus2jane.py` (see instructions in `2_jane_nexus`).

## Parsing Jane outputs

To parse the output files produced under each cost regime, one can run the script `parse_jane_files.py`. In this example, the files that will be processed can be found in `example_input` (files named `results_CR##`).

```
python parse_jane_files.py --directory example_input
```

Check the directory `examples_output` to see the expected outputs.

### Dependencies

For running `parse_jane_files.py`, the following Python 3 packages must be installed:


* pandas
* argparse
